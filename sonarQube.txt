  -(static code analysis)
  -one of the effective static analysis tool to improve code quality,i.e continuous inspection is happened so that the code
    thoroughly tested at each step so that atlast we get a proper output.
  - It tells the better way of analysing the code for best practices.

software characteristics:
1.naming conventions should be followed.
2.duplicate code should not be used.
3.logic should not be complex.
4.the code has unit tests.
5.code should have good design and architecture.
6.the public API should have good documentation and commands.
7.the code should not have any bugs and performence issues.


Error Attributes:  
Blocker       - 5
Critical      - 4
Major         - 3
Minor         - 2
Info          - 1

Need of static code analysis:
1.detective errors.
2.code formatting.
3.metrics computation.

Checkstyles:
open source tool that focus on the code conventions.

PMD:
   main focus:Bad Practices
Ex:
  catching exception without doing anything.
  having dead code
  too many complex method
  direct use of implementations instead of interfaces 
  synchronization on boolean
  
diff b/w function and procedure:
function:
    -may or maynot return a value.
    -to perform some computations.
procedure:
    -it should not have a return type.
    -to perform actions like insert,update,delete.

SonarQube:
  collects and analysis source code ,measuring quality and providing reports for your projects.
  it combines static and dynamic analysis tool.
  it covers coding rules,test coverages,duplication,API documentation complexity and architecture providing these details in the dash board.
